# ProjectPlanner
 Helps users plan their projects

To run this you will need npm and electron.js.

Once those are installed, navigate to the base directory of this repository, run npm install, and npm start. This will launch the app.

# **Future plans:**
Task page:

    redesign the page to make it clearer and easier to edit tasks
    add options to have other resources other than budget
    
Criteria Page:

    add the option for criteria to have importance adjustment factors like safety and environment to help prioritize certain criteria
    
Budget Page:

    make it so users can manually change the importance of certain tasks by dragging
    make it so users can view the tasks information on click
    
Overall:

    overhaul the visuals to change color scheme and interface in general (nothing specifc, just want it to look nicer and more polished)
    provide clearer save and import features
    allow collaboration between several users
